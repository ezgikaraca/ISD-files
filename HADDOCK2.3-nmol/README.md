# Modified HADDOCK protocols

The protocols here are additions to the HADDOCK version 2.3 software (not yet the official current distribution) required to run the N molecule protocol.
They basically extend HADDOCK's capabilities pass the 6 molecule limit.

The additional modified files are in the following subdirectoris:

* _toppar_: Contains additional files for the initial placement of molecules in space and combined protein-nucleic acids topologies and parameters
* _protocols_: Contains the additional and modified CNS scripts to extend HADDOCK's capabilities to 20 molecules
* _Haddock_: Contains the modified HADDOCK python scripts.

In order to run the ISD protocol, you should request a version of HADDOCK2.3-nmol. 
For this please send via e-mail to Alexandre Bonvin (a.m.j.j.bonvin@uu.nl) a [signed license](http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/haddock_lic)
for HADDOCK (free for academic usage), specifically requesting the N-molecule version to run the ISD framework.
This special version contains a fully working HADDOCK2.3-nmol ISD framework (and thus includes the modified files provided here).

The instructions to use our HADDOCK2.3-nmol framework are similar to the standard HADDOCK software, described in http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/
