############  HOW TO CALCULATE RESTRAINT VIOLATION STATISTICS #############

# 1. When it0 is finished, the following csh script should be used to extract restraint violation energies (from the header of the coordinate files):

./get_EExp_values.csh

# get_EExp_values.csh script outputs the viol file, which includes:
# violation energies of all structures, ordered according to file.nam

# 2. Boxplot statistics of the viol file can be carried out in Matlab. In principle any other statistics tool can be run, which takes the viol file as an input and outputs the outliers of a box-and-whisker statistics with whisker extensions of 2IQR.
# The "outlier" threshold value can be calculated within matlab:

load viol
h = boxplot(log(viol(:,1)),'whisker',2)
to_th = get(h(2),'ydata')
th = to_th(1) % dumps the final threshold value

# 3. The threshold value defines the limit of the "outlier" selection at the end of it0.
# For this, "th" value should be taken from the previous matlab step and put in the following awk one-liner:

awk '{print $1,log($2)}' energies | awk '$2<= th' | awk '{print $1}' > viol.sele

# 4. When the outlier list is generated and saved in viol.sele, the new it0 energy files (file.nam, file.list, file.cns) should be generated by the following script,
#    which uses viol.sele file as an input.

./generate_new_it0_files.csh

This script generates a new directory called file_reserve and saves the old energy files there.
