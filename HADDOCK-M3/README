# Modified HADDOCK protocols

The protocols here are modifications of the original HADDOCK (v.2.2) files. They will *not* work with standard versions of the software.
To use them, please e-mail Alexandre Bonvin (a.m.j.j.bonvin@uu.nl) and ask for a license of HADDOCK (free for academic usage), specifically mentioning the M3 framework.

The instructions to use our HADDOCK-M3 framework are similar to the standard HADDOCK software, described in http://www.bonvinlab.org/software/haddock2.2/
