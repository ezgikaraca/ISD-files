# Integrative Structure Determination files:

To use this software you need a special version of HADDOCK. 
Please ask it by sending an e-mail to Alexandre Bonvin (a.m.j.j.bonvin@uu.nl).

The README files and scripts to the HADDOCK-M3 framework are located under `analysis_scripts`. 
The starting structures, restraints files, and final models for each benchmark case are given under 
the respective folder in `cases/`. Finally, statistics within this framework are calculated using Matlab, 
although in principle any other statistics toolkit/programming language can be used instead.

If you use this software in your work, please cite us:
