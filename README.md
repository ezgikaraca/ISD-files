# Integrative Structure Determination files:

To use this software you need a special version of HADDOCK. 
See for that the README file under the HADDOCK2.3-nmol directory.

The additional scripts to perform analysis and model selection in the HADDOCK2.3-nmol framework are located under `analysis_scripts`. 
See the README file in that directory.

Starting structures, restraints files, and final models for each benchmark case are given under 
the respective folder in `cases/`. Each case also contains an example `new.html` and instructions about specific HADDOCK parameter settings.

Finally, statistics within this framework are calculated using Matlab, 
although in principle any other statistics toolkit/programming language can be used instead.
